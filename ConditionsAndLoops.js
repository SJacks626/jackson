// write code that will set the value of studentClass based on studentGrade
// studentGrade will be K-12
// K-6 will be Elementary
// 7-8 will be Middle
// 9 will be Freshman, 10 Sophomore, 11 Junior, 12 Senior
// Anything other than these values will return "Error" to the console





// write a for loop that will iterate backwards from 10 to -10
for(let i=10; i>= -10; i--)
console.log(i);



// write a do/while loop that prints 1 through 50


// edit the previous do/while loop so that it prints the remainder when the loop number is divided by 4


 Someone messed up the following for loop
// fix the following infinite loop, uncomment to test
 
    for(let i = 11; i <= 10; i++){
        console.log(i);
    } 
     for(let i = 11; i <= 11; i++){
        console.log(i)
 }
